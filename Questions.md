Question 1: Hello,
I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:
 <br />
•	Records <br />
•	Indexing
 <br />
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

**Hello, George!
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reaching out! I can certainly help you with your questions.** <br />
<br />
**- Records are any object that you add to an index that you want to search for. They can contain a multitude of attributes that are used by your searching and/or filtering processes.**
<br />
<br />
**-	You can think of indexing as the way that the data source is being used by your search engine. An index is almost like a data table, except that it is optimized for your search operations through processes such as setting attributes and configuring their relevance settings.**
<br />
<br />
**-	Custom ranking metrics are a great place to implement more specific metrics to your use-case in order to specify what attributes to rank on. For example, an e-commerce platform may consider the number of sales for specific products as the most important custom ranking metric when deciding how to return search results, followed by how many people currently have said item in their cart.**
<br />
<br />
**I've attached some relevant documentation below, as well. I hope this information is helpful! Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions!**

Question 2: Hello,
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.
Regards, Matt

**Hello, Matt!**

**We always value user feedback here at Algolia. Have you had a chance to try out iterating using our APIs? This can be a very efficient method and save plenty of time for you when it comes to managing indices. I have attached some API Reference documentation for you below, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.**

Question 3: Hi,
I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?
Regards, Leo

**Hello, Leo!**

**I appreciate you reaching out to us. Algolia has plenty of features within the dashboard that can speed up the implementation process. It was built to be used by both developers and non-developers. We also offer a variety of plugins and libraries to speed up the development process. I will attach some links to documentation on both below.**

**I think you could also benefit greatly from sitting down with one of our Solutions Engineers to talk more in-depth about your project, they can even walk you through a demo of Algolia. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you’re ready to schedule that call!**
