# nba-encyclopedia-app

_This project was generated with [create-instantsearch-app](https://github.com/algolia/create-instantsearch-app) by [Algolia](https://algolia.com)._

This is an NBA Encyclopedia for all fans, ranging from young to old! Leveraging Algolia's APIs, you are able to look up NBA teams by their team name or location. You can also filter the teams by the number of championships they have won. This is made possible by taking advantage of the Algolia instantSearch.js library and configuring searchable attributes. All the NBA history information came from a JSON file inspired by the one provided through Algoliaâ€™s GitHub datasets, that was uploaded directly via the dashboard, within seconds! Images are hosted using cloudinary image APIs.

So look up your favorite team and learn a thing or two more about NBA history, or secure some bragging rights for your favorite team! 

Algolia's products are very easy to use and can play a crucial part to any application. Throughout the entire development process, the documentation as well as the online support community are both wonderful resources.
